# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction
The goal of Errand Planner is to use the locations of what you have planned in a day to actively suggest time slots for you to run errands. For example, if your daily calendar has all of your classes and their locations scheduled in. Using a list of errands you have entered, the program would suggest you an ideal time  to complete the errand. Errands would have preferred locations, deadlines, durations, and priorities. Other features could include having a destination that needs to be reached immediately after an errand, such as home after getting groceries or buying something expensive or bulky.

## Methods

In the course of this sprint, our team had compiled wireframes, which represent a fundamental visual prototype of a digital product, such as a web page, application or other. These wireframes essentially map out the layout, structure and functionality of the product, in a simplistic manner that does not focus much on design aesthetics. Their purpose is to conceptualize and plan the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the product, as a preliminary step before moving into the more intricate design phase.

Followed by a cognitive walkthrough, which is a usability evaluation method that aims to assess the ease of use and effectiveness of a product or system, through the perspective of its intended users. This process typically involves a team of evaluators (our peers) who simulate the actions and thought processes of the product's target users while performing typical tasks or scenarios. Through this evaluation, our peers identified potential areas where the product may cause confusion or require additional support or information to better support the user's decision-making process.


## Findings

From the insights gathered during the cognitive walkthrough, we have identified several opportunities to optimize the user experience of the product. Specifically, we recognize the potential benefit of implementing interactive calendar fields on the front-end, which would allow users to seamlessly navigate and create events without having to manually initiate the create function.Furthermore, we have identified the potential for user confusion with regards to the date and time input format in the calendar fields. As a solution, we recommend integrating placeholder text within these fields to provide users with clearer guidance and support.Another opportunity for improvement we have identified is the integration of a Google Maps API to enable autofill functionality for address fields. This feature would greatly enhance the user experience by streamlining the process of entering location information and reducing the likelihood of errors or user frustration.Overall, these insights offer valuable guidance for enhancing the usability and functionality of the product, and we look forward to implementing these recommendations in future iterations.


## Conclusions
The insights from the cognitive walkthrough have revealed several areas of opportunity to enhance the product's usability and increase efficiency. Firstly, we have recognized the potential for simplifying the data entry process, thereby reducing the time and effort required to add tasks. Secondly, the integration of an address autofill feature has been identified as a solution to rule out any potential inaccuracies that could arise from manual address entry. Lastly, simplifying the user interface and adopting a more interactive calendar layout has been identified as another opportunity for improvement. Overall, these recommendations offer valuable guidance for enhancing the product's usability and streamlining the user experience. By implementing these insights, we believe the product will become more effective and efficient, while also improving user satisfaction.

## Caveats

It is important to note that the cognitive walkthrough was performed by a single user, which may limit the generalizability of the results. However, despite this caveat, the insights gathered from the cognitive walkthrough can still provide valuable guidance for improving the product's usability and enhancing the user experience. Overall, while the results of a single-user cognitive walkthrough should be interpreted with caution, they can still provide valuable insights that can be used to guide product development and refinement efforts.
