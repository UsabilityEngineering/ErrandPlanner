# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

The goal of Errand Planner is to use the locations of what you have planned in a day to actively suggest time slots for you to run errands. For example, if your daily calendar has all of your classes and their locations scheduled in. Using a list of errands you have entered, the program would suggest you an ideal time  to complete the errand. Errands would have preferred locations, deadlines, durations, and priorities. Other features could include having a destination that needs to be reached immediately after an errand, such as home after getting groceries or buying something expensive or bulky.

## Methods

During the first phase of the project, we did intensive research on our market competitors as well as the demographic of the targeted users to gauge the product’s market presence as well as its face value and usefulness. We implemented UX research strategies such as
1) **Competitive Analysis** provides the entrepreneur with information about how competitors market their business and ways to penetrate the market by entry through product or service gaps in areas that your competitors do not serve or do not serve well.
2) **Heuristic Evaluation** is a usability inspection method that asks usability practitioners and other stakeholders to evaluate a user interface based on a set of principles or commonsense rules.
3) **Identifying targeted demographics** Some of these are gender, age, income level, race, education level, religion, marital status, and geographic location.
4) **Creating personas and scenarios of possible users**. Personas are often based on the area of focus or domain you are working within as a lens to highlight the relevant attitudes and the specific context associated with the area of work. Scenarios describe the stories and context behind why a specific user or user group comes to your site.  They note the goals and questions to be achieved and sometimes define the possibilities of how the user(s) can achieve them on the site.


## Findings

While conducting our market research through competitive analysis we concluded that our product is one of its kind since our immediate completion is with google calender and google maps combined but this also requires switching applications to achieve what we are trying to via Errand Planner. We established that our targeted audience ranges from students to adults working in cooperating settings. But it also stretches out from stay-at-home parents to entrepreneurs. This meant that we had to cater to a vast variety of users and need to consider every possible use of the product. To better understand how the product will be useful to the consumers we created scenarios and personas and concluded that our product needed four basic functionality; being able to import google and outlook calendars, add and remove errands, automate errand suggestions, map the locations of the errand to figure out the optimized route and add a notes section for each errand for more details. During heuristic evalution of Google suite we concluded that the design layout of the website needs to be failrly simple. 


## Conclusions

From these findings, we have concluded that the UX design of this product needs to be very intuitive and easy to use. The mental model of a calendar should be easily translated into the conceptual model. Our initial design included a single-page website which only displayed a calendar and had a map integrated in the task list. After all the research we quickly came to the conclusion the errands also need to be displayed on a separate page for quick reference so that the user can access them as needed. Another major change in design was to be able to accept or reject suggested errands. This would give the user flexibility and make the product more efficient.From heuristic evaluationof other similar websites,  we also deduced that the layout of calender and the design of the website should be kept fairly minimal and all the errands need to be color co-ordinated with categories as well as the errands should be able to have a priority and need to be scheduled accordingly.  


## Caveats

In our research so far, we have not encountered any caveats but our main concern so far is being able to implement travelling salesman problem and make sure that the processing time is fast enough that it doesn’t slow down the website.
