# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

The goal of Errand Planner is to use the locations of what you have planned in a day to actively suggest time slots for you to run errands. For example, if your daily calendar has all of your classes and their locations scheduled in. Using a list of errands you have entered, the program would suggest you an ideal time  to complete the errand. Errands would have preferred locations, deadlines, durations, and priorities. Other features could include having a destination that needs to be reached immediately after an errand, such as home after getting groceries or buying something expensive or bulky.

## Methods

During the first phase of the project, we did intensive research on our market competitors as well as the demographic of the targeted users to gauge the productâ€™s market presence as well as its face value and usefulness. We implemented UX research strategies such as
1) **Competitive Analysis** provides the entrepreneur with information about how competitors market their business and ways to penetrate the market by entry through product or service gaps in areas that your competitors do not serve or do not serve well.
2) **Heuristic Evaluation** is a usability inspection method that asks usability practitioners and other stakeholders to evaluate a user interface based on a set of principles or commonsense rules.
3) **Identifying targeted demographics**, Some of these are gender, age, income level, race, education level, religion, marital status, and geographic location.
4) **Creating personas and scenarios of possible users**. Personas are often based on the area of focus or domain you are working within as a lens to highlight the relevant attitudes and the specific context associated with the area of work. Scenarios describe the stories and context behind why a specific user or user group comes to your site.  They note the goals and questions to be achieved and sometimes define the possibilities of how the user(s) can achieve them on the site.


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
